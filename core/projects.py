project_1_description = "This 5.6MW project was completed ahead of schedule by a team of 5 electricians and mechanical contractors. A total of\
    10,368 540W Panels, 32 120KVA 3 phase Solaredge inverters, 2x Schweitzer SEL 751 Feeder Protection relays installed on a commercial site in AR.\
    |My primary responsibility on this site was to install the inverters, verify string voltages, and plan and provide oversight of the installation\
    of the network cable, network cable conduit, environmental sensor network, Ageto Systems monitoring system, and feeder protection relays.\
    |Aside from the blistering heat of the Arkansas Summer, this was one of my favorite projects I have ever worked on, and was able to demonstrate my\
    understanding of 3 phase power systems, IT infrastructure, and passion for building awesome stuff."
